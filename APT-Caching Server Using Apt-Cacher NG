Setting Up an APT-Caching Server Using Apt-Cacher NG

Objective:
The primary objective of this configuration is to establish an APT (Advanced Package Tool) caching server on the "sp-temp-dbrestore" server. This server, acting as a caching proxy, will efficiently manage and distribute software packages, significantly improving package management on connected servers. A key aspect of this setup is to restrict internet access for clients to protect them from the internet while allowing limited access only to the caching server.

Server Overview:

1. Server with Internet Access (sp-temp-db restore):
   - This server enjoys unrestricted access to the internet.
   - It operates as the APT-Caching Server.
   - Its primary role is to serve as a centralized repository for APT packages.

2. Server with Limited Internet Access (sp-temp-dbrestore2):
   - This server does not possess direct internet connectivity.
   - Internet access is expressly blocked for this server, except for interactions with the APT-Caching Server (sp-temp-dbrestore).

Deployment Process:

Step 1: Configuration of the APT-Caching Server (sp-temp-dbrestore)

- Update and Upgrade: Keep the server up to date:
   
   apt-get update -y
   apt-get upgrade -y
   

- Installation of Apt-Cacher NG:Install Apt-Cacher NG:
   
   apt-get install apt-cacher-ng -y
   
- Service Activation:Enable and start the Apt-Cacher NG service:
  
   systemctl start apt-cacher-ng
   systemctl enable apt-cacher-ng
  

- Service Status Verification: Check the status of Apt-Cacher NG:
  
   systemctl status apt-cacher-ng
 

-Port Validation:Confirm that Apt-Cacher NG is actively listening on port 3142:

      ss -altnp | grep apt
   
Step 2: Configuration of the Client Server (sp-temp-dbrestore2)

- Client Configuration: Configure the client to utilize "sp-temp-dbrestore" as its primary APT package source. Edit the configuration file:
  
   nano /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/00aptproxy
  
   Insert this line, replace `your-server-ip` with the IP address of "sp-temp-dbrestore":

     Acquire::http::Proxy "http://your-server-ip:3142";
  
   Save the file.

-Internet Access Restriction: Use `iptables` to block all outgoing internet connections from "dbrestore2," except for connections to "sp-temp-dbrestore." Allow port 443 for HTTPS and accept input at port 443 from "sp-temp-dbrestore." Execute the following commands:
  
   iptables -A OUTPUT -j DROP
   iptables -I OUTPUT -d your-server-ip -j ACCEPT
   iptables -I INPUT -s your-server-ip -p tcp --sport 443 -j ACCEPT
   
Validation and Testing:

- Verify the functionality of the system by installing software packages, such as Grafana and NumPy, on "sp-temp-dbrestore2."

Access Restriction for Enhanced Security:
- The primary focus of this configuration is to block internet access for client servers, providing protection against external threats while allowing controlled access only to the caching server.

Log Monitoring:
- Apt-Cacher NG logs on "dbrestore" (Cacher Server) are stored in "/var/log/apt-cacher-ng/." 

Monitor these logs with:
   
   tail -f /var/log/apt-cacher-ng/apt-cacher.log
  

Conclusion:

By establishing an APT-Caching Server using Apt-Cacher NG on "sp-temp-dbrestore," we have significantly improved package management efficiency on "sp-temp-dbrestore2." The latter can now seamlessly access and install software packages, relying on the caching server as its primary source. This architecture enhances security, reliability, and speed in software deployment.
